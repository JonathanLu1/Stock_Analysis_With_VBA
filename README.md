# Stock_Analysis_With_VBA


# Overview of the Project


**Project Purpose**

The coding that we had used previously to anaylze stocks were running extremely slow and would not be able to handle the amount of stocks that Steve had wanted to analyze. We go back into the code and refactor it in order to enhance the amount of data that it is able to process at once. The code that we had written was able to process stocks for 365 days for 12 different stocks. With this code, we are able to calculate data on a much larger scale, which allows us to read the data much better.

# Results

**Refactored Code**
  
The refactored code was designed by using FOR loops and IF statements to get the computer to analzye the data through all the rows of the data. The FOR loops were used to loop our computer through all the rows that contained data within the spreadsheet. Within the FOR loop we place our IF statements to proces all the data within the sheets for 2017 and 2018.

  This allows us to loop through all the data and find out the annual return for each stock over the year. With the refactored code, we can also place code to see the time that it took for us to complete the analysis with the refactored code, which is significantly lower than the previous version of the code. Formatting the table that is created from the data collected also allows us to easily understand which stocks performed well and which ones underperformed.

# Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring

**Advantages**

The biggest advantage of refactoring the code is allowing the code to be clean and run much more efficiently. Another advantage of refactoring is allowing it to be straight forward and easy for people to understand. This will also allow people to debug programs more effectively because it is easier to understand. The process that is depicted with the refactored code improves to quality and how it is applied to the applications that are being created. The cleaner design will also make it much easier for developers to change the code if it needs to be altered to serve a different purpose or even to add more content to the application. 

**Disadvantages**

The disadvantages of refactoring code include the amount of time that it takes to clean it up. Sometimes it may take a large amount of time to create code that is more efficient and readable. There are so many ways to code a single project that the time it takes to create a more efficient version may be very time consuming. Another disadvantage is that it may increase the file size and make it a larger file depending on the amount of memeory that it takes. 

# Differences in the Code

The biggest difference between the different code was the quality of each code. The original code was much more cluttered and was not structured in a way that was understandable. The efficiency in the code was also extremely low and did not analyze the data at a fast pace. The refactored code contained more coding than what the original had but ran at a much faster pace and also allowed us to run more data at once. The downside of creating the refactored code was the amount of time that it took to create it. The original code was much easier to create and was much simpler, but with the refactored we are able to complile much more and create a bug free program that is much cleaner. 

# Summary
This assignment has shown that refactored code is much more beneficial if you have the time and resources at your disposal. Although it may be time consuming to begin with, the amount of time that you will spend debugging and processing data without the refactored code should be able to make up for the time that it took to create the code. Coding should be about efficiency and creating a cleaner and more concise code will teach much more than creating the easier option that will not run as efficiently.
